# duck-bear-bank
A tool for currency exchange rate comparison. Should be deployed together with other projects including bodb(frontend), bochk, hang-seng, and hsbc, which can be found in my repositories.  

No need to go through this project thoroughly, because it is barely a trivial homework project. It is much simpler compared to my former real stuff.
